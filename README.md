## Git/Branch strategy  

- Every feature has it's own branch, usually 2 team members would work on one feature  
- We each have our own personal branch  
  - Naming convention: BranchName_FirstnameLastname  
- Team communication states that only designated members should work on specific issues.  
- Team members should push and pull request the feature branch once a day when they are developing  

## Code Quality Guide

We're using University of Washington CSE 154â€™s code quality and style guide as a reference.

## Story lifecycle

*When is a developed story ready to test?*  
When all the acceptance criteria has been met.

*How do you plan to test?*

- Manual test
- test with Postman
- linter with GitHub Actions
- Try testing with Jasmine

*Who should test stories?*  
First, test our own code, then request a teammate to test our code.  

*Do stories need approval before merging?*  
At least one other teammate should comment and approve before merging.  

## Definition of Ready

*When is a story ready to be moved from the backlog into a sprint?*  
After a team meeting, and members have been assigned to work on an issue that week

*What information should it have?*  
It should have the relevant user story, libraries or API needed to implement the feature, members assigned to work on the feature, and a deadline.

## Definition of Done

*When is a story development complete and ready to be marked as done?*  
When testing is finished, teammates approve the pull request, and merge the final result from the feature branch to the master/main branch.
